# Task SW Development - Sameer
## Task: Tariff Comparison
Thank you for giving me the opportunity, enjoyed working on it.  Below are steps and implementation details.


##  Steps: to run and start the application

 - **npm install**
- **nodemon app.js**   - it will start and listen to port 5000 
- **npm test** - it will test the unit and integration tests.

## Implementation Details

- **Design:**     I have attempted to design in a way to integrate future products with ease. It will be easy to integrate the Api.
- **Validation:** Input is validated to accept only non-negative integers
- **Tests:**         Have written unit and integration test during service and model implementation. Also added a sample output of loadtest - tested on my machine.
- **Const:**       Files in const folder can be thought as data coming from database since those are products agreed constants for calculation.
- **REST_SERVICE_GET_PRODUCTS:** http://localhost:5000/api/products/3500
